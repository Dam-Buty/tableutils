","body":"### About the **tableutils** plugin\r\nThere are a lot of jQuery plugins available for doing things like fixing the table header, filtering/searching the table contents, sorting the table, paginating it on client-side, paginating it on server-side, adding new records to a table dynamically, editing the records on the fly, deleting records from the table, etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, not many plugins have all these functionality. So why not use a single plugin to do all these things instead of using a number of plugins. This is exactly what tableutils is. It includes all these functionality, so that you get everything in one little plugin. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Fix table header\r\n* Scroll the fixed header horizontally with the table body for larger tables\r\n* Search/Filter data in the table\r\n* Sort data in the table.\r\n* Add a Checkbox to select/de-select all rows\r\n* Select rows by clicking on them\r\n* Client-side JavaScript pagination\r\n* Server-side Pagination\r\n* Supports numeric, alphabetic and alphanumeric pagination\r\n* Add new records to the table dynamically\r\n* Update records in the table\r\n* Delete records from the table\r\n* Add buttons to your table to perform related operations\r\n* See information about sorting, filtering, pagination, etc in a stylish way with a custom message queue\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nSee the plugin in action at [Demo](http://kolgepratik.github.com/tableutils/demo.html)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nLike every other jQuery plugin out there, installation is super easy.\r\n\r\n1. Add jQuery libraries to your page. \r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jqueryUI.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add tableutils script file to your page. \r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/tableutils.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add your favourite jquery UI theme css to your page.\r\n```\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/flick/jqueryUI.css\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Add tableutils css file to your page.\r\n```\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/tableutils.css\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd its done.!! That was easy right ? Now, go ahead and use the plugin to create incredibly smart tables.\r\n\r\n### How to use the plugin\r\nCreate the HTML for table. You don't have to do anything special here. But there are a few things you should know:\r\n\r\n1. Specify the width for the table in pixels.\r\n\r\n2. Specify the width for each individual column in the table (column width need not be in pixels i.e. you can use percentage width for columns). The widths for the headers and body must match for the plugin to work properly. \r\n\r\n3. Specify thead and tbody section in the table. thead will hold the table header and tbody will be the body of the table.  \r\n\r\nApart from this nothing more needs to be special about the table. You see, everything here is just a basic table in HTML. See an example below: \r\n```\r\n<table id=\"mySimpleTable\" width=\"800px\">\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th width=\"20%\">First Name</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th width=\"20%\">Last Name</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th width=\"10%\">Department</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th width=\"10%\">Age</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th width=\"40%\">Address</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"20%\">Pratik</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"20%\">Kolge</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"10%\">IT</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"10%\">23</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td width=\"40%\">Pune, India</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t... \r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, script the following code: \r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n    $(document).ready(function() {\r\n        $('#mySimpleTable').tableutils( options );\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there you go, your very simple table transforms into something more lively. Go ahead and explore the awesome features of this plugin. I am sure you would love it. \r\n\r\nFor a complete list of available options, see the [Documentation](https://github.com/kolgepratik/tableutils/wiki/tableutils-Documentation)\r\n\r\nHave a look at the [Demo](http://kolgepratik.github.com/tableutils/demo.html).\r\n\r\n### A note\r\nWhen I first started to write this code, I never thought that I will expand it so much. My aim was to just fix the table header since i had seen so many different methods for fixing the headers. And i wanted a simple method that isn't implemented using any CSS to avoid cross-browser irregularities. \r\nBut over the time, many things were added to the code. Some of things are too basic and need to be more standard in the code which is done meanwhile. The plugin does not makes any claims or provide any guarantee on its usefulness. [Have a look at it at](http://kolgepratik.github.com/tableutils/demo.html) and try it out. It is amazing. I would really love if anyone wants to contribute to make the plugin better. \r\n\r\n### Help and Support\r\nHaving trouble with the plugin?
